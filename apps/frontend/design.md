## 🌈 Color System
**Primary Colors**  
- Primary-500: Core brand actions (e.g., "Add to Cart").  
- Primary-400: Hover states, sale tags.  
- Primary-900: Headers and high-emphasis text.

**Neutral Palette**  
- Gray shades for text, borders, and backgrounds.  
- White for clean backgrounds and product frames.

**Status Colors**  
- Green for success confirmations.  
- Yellow for warnings or limited stock.  
- Red for errors or urgent messages.

## ✍️ Typography
**Font Families**  
- **Headings**: Inter – Bold, clean, and modern.  
- **Body Text**: Inter – Regular, optimized for readability.

**Hierarchy**  
- **H1** – Main page titles (landing pages, product categories).  
- **H2** – Section headings (featured products, filters).  
- **H3-H5** – Subsections, product metadata.  
- **Body** – Standard content, product descriptions.

**Guidelines**  
- Keep line length between 45–75 characters for optimal reading comfort.  
- Maintain consistent letter-spacing and line-height.  
- Use headings for structure, not visual decoration.  
- Avoid more than three font sizes in a single view for simplicity.

## 📐 Layout & Spacing
**Grid System**  
- **Desktop**: 12-column grid with generous margins.  
- **Tablet**: 8-column grid.  
- **Mobile**: 4-column grid.  
- Maintain consistent gutter widths across breakpoints.

**Spacing Scale**  
- XS – Minimal spacing (tight UI elements).  
- SM – Small gaps between related elements.  
- MD – Default section padding.  
- LG – Section breaks or separating unrelated groups.  
- XL – Large visual breathing space.

**Guidelines**  
- Use spacing consistently for rhythm and alignment.  
- Align products and cards to the grid for visual order.  
- Maintain padding inside containers for readability.  
- Avoid crowding interactive elements to ensure usability.
